 ## Tribute page

This is a mock tribute page to the car manufacturer Subaru.
To get this page to run properly you'll need all of the contents of the "Tribute_page" directory. 
Make sure you don't take any of the files out of their directories as this will ruin the HTML links.

## Technical Documentation page

This is a mock technical documentation page. 
To get this page to run properly you'll need all of the contents of the "Technical_Documentation_page" directory. 
Make sure you don't take any of the files out of their directories as this will ruin the HTML links.
