 ## Tribute Page

This is a mock tribute page to the car manufacturer Subaru.
To get this page to run properly you'll need all of the contents of the "Tribute_page" directory. 
Make sure you don't take any of the files out of their respected directories as this will ruin the HTML links.
Now that you have all the directories and files, open the "index.html" file located in "Tribute_page/HTML/" directory and the page will run.

### Front-End Design
